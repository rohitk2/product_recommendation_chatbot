# Product Recommendation Chatbot

An AI-powered chatbot that collects user preferences through conversation and recommends Apple products using Claude and LangGraph.

## Project Files

| File | Description |
|------|-------------|
| `server.py` | FastAPI server that manages chat sessions and exposes `/start` and `/chat` endpoints for the frontend. |
| `chatbot.py` | LangGraph-based conversational agent that uses Claude to collect user preferences and query a product database for recommendations. |
| `index.html` | Single-page chat UI that renders the conversation and displays recommended products as styled cards with Amazon search links. |
| `products.csv` | Dataset of 30+ Apple products (laptops, phones, tablets, wearables, etc.) with specs like price, battery life, RAM, and storage. |

## Brief Explanation

1. **Session start** -- The user opens the page, triggering a `GET /start` call that creates a new session and invokes the LangGraph graph with an initial greeting.
2. **Preference collection** -- The `orchestrator_agent` node sends the conversation to Claude with a system prompt instructing it to ask about preferences one at a time: product category, budget, battery life, storage, and RAM.
3. **User interaction loop** -- Each user message is sent via `POST /chat`, appended to the conversation history, and passed back through the orchestrator. Claude validates answers and asks the next question.
4. **Preference extraction** -- After all 5 preferences are collected, Claude responds with a structured JSON block. The `extract_preferences` function parses this into a validated `UserPreferences` object.
5. **Conditional routing** -- The `should_query_products` edge checks if preferences are complete. If yes, it routes to `product_query_execute`; otherwise the conversation continues.
6. **Product recommendation** -- `product_query_execute` filters `products.csv` by category, sorts by the user's stated preferences (high/low), and returns the top 3 matches.
7. **Results display** -- The server returns the product list to the frontend, which renders each product as a card with specs and an Amazon search link.
